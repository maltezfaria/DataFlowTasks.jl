#
# This example illustrate the use of `DataFlowTasks.jl` to parallelize the tiled
# application of two kernels used in image processing. The application first
# applies a blur filter on each pixel of the image; in a second step, the [Roberts
# cross operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberts_cross) is applied to
# detect edges in the image.
#
# Let us first load a test image:

using Images
url = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Equus_zebra_hartmannae_-_Etosha_2015.jpg"
ispath("test-image.jpg") || download(url, "test-image.jpg")
img = Gray.(load("test-image.jpg"))

# We start by defining a few helper functions:
#
# - the `contract` and `expand` functions manipulate ranges of indices in order
#   to respectively contract or expand them by a few pixels;
#
# - the `img2mat` and `mat2img` convert between a Gray-scale image and a matrix
#   of floating-point pixel intensities. The filters will work on this latter
#   representation, which may need a renormalization to be converted back to a
#   Gray-scale image.

contract(range,n) = range[begin+n:end-n]
expand(range,n)   = range[begin]-n:range[end]-n

function img2mat(img)
    PixelType = eltype(img)
    mat = Float64.(img)
    return (PixelType, mat)
end

function mat2img(PixelType, mat)
    m1, m2 = extrema(mat)
    PixelType.((mat .- m1) ./ (m2-m1))
end

PixelType, mat = img2mat(img);

# ## Filters implementation
#
# The `blur!` function averages the value of each pixel with the values of all
# pixels less than `width` pixels away in manhattan distance. In order to
# simplify the implementation, the filter is applied only to pixels that are
# sufficiently far from the boundary to have all their neighbors correctly
# defined.
#
# Results are written in-place in a pre-allocated `dest` array. Unless otherwise
# specified, the filter is applied to the whole image, but can be reduced to a
# tile if a smaller `range` argument is provided.

function blur!(dest, src; range=axes(src), width)
    ri, rj = intersect.(range, contract.(axes(src), width))

    weight = 1/(2*width+1)^2
    @inbounds for i in ri, j in rj
        dest[i,j] = 0
        for δi in -width:width, δj in -width:width
            dest[i,j] += src[i+δi, j+δj]
        end
        dest[i,j] *= weight
    end
end

# In the following, we'll use a filter width of 5 pixels, which produces the
# following results on the test image:

width = 5
blurred = zero(mat)

blur!(blurred, mat; width)

mat2img(PixelType, blurred)

#  The `roberts!` function applies the Roberts cross operator to the provided
#  image. Like above, it operates by default on all pixels in the image
#  (provided they are sufficiently far from the boundaries), but can be
#  restricted to work on a tile if the `range` argument is provided.

function roberts!(dest, src; range=axes(src))
    ri, rj = intersect.(range, contract.(axes(src), 1))

    for i in ri, j in rj
        dest[i,j] = (
            + (sqrt(src[i,  j]) - sqrt(src[i+1,j+1]))^2
            + (sqrt(src[i+1,j]) - sqrt(src[i  ,j+1]))^2
        )^(0.25)
    end
end

# Applying this edge detection filter on the original image produces the
# following results:

contour = zero(mat)
roberts!(contour, mat)

mat2img(PixelType, contour)

# Chaining the blur and roberts filters may make edge detection less noisy:

function blur_roberts!(img; width, tmp=zero(img))
    blur!(tmp, img; width)
    roberts!(img, tmp)
end

mat1 = copy(mat)
tmp  = zero(mat)

blur_roberts!(mat1; width, tmp)
mat2img(PixelType, mat1)

# The elapsed time in this sequential version will serve as reference to
# evaluate the performance of other implementations:

using BenchmarkTools
t_seq = @belapsed blur_roberts!(x, width=$width, tmp=$tmp) setup=(x=copy(mat)) evals=1

# ## Tiled filter application
#
# The [`TiledIteration.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaArrays/TiledIteration.jl)
# package implements various tools allowing to define and iterate over disjoint
# tiles of a larger array. We'll use it to apply the filters tile by tile.
#
# The `map_tiled!` higher-order function automates the application of a filter
# `fun!` on all pixels of an image `src` decomposed with a tilesize `ts`. This
# higher-order function is then used to define tiled versions of the blur and
# roberts filters.

using TiledIteration

function map_tiled!(fun!, dest, src, ts)
    for tile in TileIterator(axes(src), (ts, ts))
        fun!(dest, src, tile)
    end
end

blur_tiled!(dest, src, ts; width) = map_tiled!(dest, src, ts) do dest, src, tile
    blur!(dest, src; width, range=tile)
end

roberts_tiled!(dest, src, ts) = map_tiled!(dest, src, ts) do dest, src, tile
    roberts!(dest, src; range=tile)
end

function blur_roberts_tiled!(img, ts; width, tmp=zero(img))
    blur_tiled!(tmp, img, ts; width)
    roberts_tiled!(img, tmp, ts)
end

# Decomposing the original image in tiles of size $512\times 512$, the tiled
# application of the filters yields the same result as above:

ts = 512

mat1 .= mat
blur_roberts_tiled!(mat1, ts; width, tmp)

mat2img(PixelType, mat1)

# Depending on the system, the fact that memory is now accessed in blocks may
# (or may not) have a significant impact on the performance, due to cache
# effects.

t_tiled = @belapsed blur_roberts_tiled!(x, ts; width=$width, tmp=$tmp) setup=(x=copy(mat)) evals=1

# ## Parallel filter application

# Parallelizing the tiled filter application is relatively straightforward using
# `DataFlowTasks.jl`. As usual, it involves specifying which data is accessed by
# each task.

using DataFlowTasks

function blur_dft!(dest, src, ts; width)
    map_tiled!(dest, src, ts) do dest, src, tile
        outer = intersect.(expand.(tile, width), axes(src))
        @dspawn begin
            @R view(src, outer...)
            @W view(dest, tile...)
            blur!(dest, src; width, range=tile)
        end label="blur ($tile)"
    end
    @dspawn @R(dest) label="blur (result)"
end

function roberts_dft!(dest, src, ts)
    map_tiled!(dest, src, ts) do dest, src, tile
        outer = intersect.(expand.(tile, 1), axes(src))
        @dspawn begin
            @R view(src, outer...)
            @W view(dest, tile...)
            roberts!(dest, src; range=tile)
        end label="roberts ($tile)"
    end
    @dspawn @R(dest) label="roberts (result)"
end

# Note how each filter spawns one task for each tile, and an extra task to get
# the results in the end. This allows applying a given filter independently of
# the other.
#
# However, the filters remain composable: when applying both filters one after
# the other, no implicit synchronization is enforced at the end of the blurring
# stage, and the runtime may decide to intersperse blurring and roberts tasks
# (as long as the blurring of a tile and all its neighbors is performed before
# the application of the roberts filter on this tile).

function blur_roberts_dft!(img, ts; width, tmp=zero(img))
    blur_dft!(tmp, img, ts; width)
    roberts_dft!(img, tmp, ts)
    @dspawn @R(img) label="result"
end

# Again this yields the same results on the test image:

mat1 .= mat;
blur_roberts_dft!(mat1, ts; width, tmp) |> wait

mat2img(PixelType, mat1)

#-

t_dft = @belapsed wait(blur_roberts_dft!(x, ts; width=$width, tmp=$tmp)) setup=(x = copy(mat)) evals=1

# ## Performance analysis

DataFlowTasks.stack_weakdeps_env!()
using CairoMakie

barplot([t_seq, t_tiled, t_dft],
        axis = (; title = "Elapsed time [s]",
                xticks=(1:3, ["sequential", "tiled", "DataFlowTasks"])))

# A comparison of the performances of all implementations shows that the
# DataFlowTasks-based implementation produces a good speedup:

(;
 nthreads = Threads.nthreads(),
 speedup = t_seq / t_dft)

# We can gain more insight by collecting profiling data:

GC.gc()
mat1 .= mat;
log_info = DataFlowTasks.@log wait(blur_roberts_dft!(mat1, ts; width, tmp))
DataFlowTasks.describe(log_info)

# The parallel trace shows how blur and roberts tasks are interspersed in the time line:

trace = plot(log_info, categories=["blur", "roberts"])
